# Sysmon
Variety of sysmon configurations for file integrity, registry, and dns monitoring.

## Automated Sysmon Installation

[sysmon_setup.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Starke427/Sysmon/master/sysmon_setup.ps1) will download Sysmon from sysinternals.com along with the default configuration file from this github. It must be run from an Administrative PowerShell.

```
$url1 = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Starke427/Sysmon/master/sysmon_setup.ps1"
$file1 = "$env:temp\sysmon_setup.ps1"
(New-Object -TypeName System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile($url1, $file1)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -force
& "$env:temp\sysmon_setup.ps1"
```

The script can be modified to automatically download a different sysmon-config by changing the url2 variable on line 10 to the desired sysmon_config.xml In order to modify the script you will need to download the sysmon_setup.ps1 script and modify it accordingly prior to execution.
